deep_focus_threshold_minutes = 30

# Focus applications
focus_apps = ["code", "vim", "emacs", "sublime"]

# Ignored applications
ignored_apps = ["system", "desktop"]

# Logging
log_level = "info"

# Notifications
[notifications]
enabled = false
interval_minutes = 60

## üìä Understanding Your Data

### Focus Sessions
- **Duration**: Time spent in focus applications
- **Deep Focus**: Sessions longer than your threshold
- **Efficiency**: Percentage of time spent in focus vs distraction

### Context Switches
- **Frequency**: How often you switch between applications
- **Recovery Time**: Time lost when switching back to focus work
- **Patterns**: Identify your most distracting applications

### Metrics Explained
- **Focus Efficiency**: `(focus_time / total_time) * 100`
- **Deep Focus Sessions**: Extended periods of focused work
- **Average Recovery Time**: Time to regain focus after switching

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Required dependencies not found"
- **Linux**: Install xdotool: `sudo pacman -S xdotool`
- **macOS**: Should work out of the box
- **Windows**: Should work out of the box

#### "Failed to initialize database"
- Check write permissions in data directory
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Try resetting configuration: `focusdebt config reset`

#### "No active window detected"
- **Linux**: Ensure xdotool is installed and working
- **macOS**: Grant accessibility permissions to terminal
- **Windows**: Run as administrator if needed

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run with verbose output
RUST_LOG=debug focusdebt start
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All data is stored locally on your machine
- No data is sent to external servers
- Database files are stored in user data directory

### Permissions
- **Linux**: Requires xdotool for window tracking
- **macOS**: May require accessibility permissions
- **Windows**: May require administrator privileges
